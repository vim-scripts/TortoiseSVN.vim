TortoiseSVN.vim will commit the current buffer to your subversion 
repository everytime you update the file or once per session (see 
|tortoiseSvnCommitOnce|). The advantage over using command line svn 
commands is that you get the TortoiseSVN GUI for committing files, 
browsing the repository etc.

Some aspects of this plugin can be configured by setting the following 
variables in your |vimrc| file.

    g:tortoiseSvnCmd :: The path to "TortoiseProc.exe".

    g:tortoiseSvnCommitOnce, b:tortoiseSvnCommitOnce :: If true, the 
    buffer will be committed to the subversion repository only once 
    (i.e., when saving the file for the first time).

    g:tortoiseSvnMenuPrefix :: If empty (''), no menu will be installed.

    g:tortoiseSvnStartCmd :: A command for detaching TortoiseProc.exe 
    from the shell (e.g., start).

    g:tortoiseSvnInstallAutoCmd :: If false, no autocmd will be 
    installed.
